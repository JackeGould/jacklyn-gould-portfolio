# Jacklyn Gould's Portfolio

## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT to create a user friendly portfolio that is accessible on multiple screen sizes for employers to view
SO THAT I can demonstrate my coding skills and readiness for real world software scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a deployed user friendly portfolio
WHEN the portfolio is deployed
THEN the viewer is presented with my name, and a navigation bar
WHEN the viewer clicks one of the links in the navigation
THEN the viewer will be directed to that section
WHEN the viewer is directed to my work
THEN the first application's image is larger in size than the others
WHEN the viewer click on the images of the applications
THEN they are taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
